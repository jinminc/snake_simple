## Implementation approach

We will use Python's built-in libraries such as curses for the CLI interface and random for generating the apple's position. The game will be object-oriented with classes for the Game, Snake, and Apple. The game's difficulty will increase by speeding up the snake as the score increases. We will use PyTest for testing to ensure minimal bugs.

## Data structures and interface definitions

        class Game{
            +int score
            +start_game()
            +end_game()
        }
        class Snake{
            +list body
            +move()
            +grow()
        }
        class Apple{
            +tuple position
            +respawn()
        }
        Game "1" -- "1" Snake: controls
        Game "1" -- "1" Apple: controls
    

## Program call flow

        participant M as Main
        participant G as Game
        participant S as Snake
        participant A as Apple
        M->>G: start_game()
        loop game loop
            G->>S: move()
            alt snake eats apple
                G->>A: respawn()
                G->>S: grow()
                G->>G: increase score
            end
        end
        G->>M: end_game()
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
